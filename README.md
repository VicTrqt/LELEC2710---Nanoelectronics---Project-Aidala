# LELEC2710---Nanoelectronics---Project-Aidala
This repository contains all the images produced with the Python package "Kwant" in the framework of the Project of LELEC2710 at UCLouvain (Groth,2014). The goal was to re-create the physics presented in (Aidala, 2007). The final report associated to this work is also present as well as the slides of the intermediary presentation.
